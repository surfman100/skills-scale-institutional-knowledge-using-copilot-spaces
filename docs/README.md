\# OctoAcme Project Management Docs



Welcome to the documentation hub for OctoAcme's project management processes. This collection centralizes the team’s workflow knowledge, templates, and checklists to make onboarding faster and to ensure consistent, high-quality execution across projects.



OctoAcme organizes projects using a clear lifecycle—initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective—to promote repeatability, stakeholder alignment, and continuous improvement. New initiatives start with a lightweight Project One‑pager that defines the problem, success metrics, and stakeholders. Approved work is broken into shippable backlog items with acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done, then tracked on a project board to visualize flow and manage dependencies. Releases follow checklist-driven staging and verification with documented rollback plans.



Roles and ownership are explicit: Project Managers (PMs) coordinate delivery, risk, and communication; Product Managers (PdMs) own outcomes and prioritization; Developers implement and test; and QA validates acceptance criteria. Communication follows a regular cadence (daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, demos/milestones, and monthly stakeholder updates) and uses templates and single sources of truth to keep stakeholders aligned and escalation paths clear.



Quality assurance combines automated CI checks (linting, unit/integration tests, security scans) with code reviews, manual QA when needed, smoke tests, and a rollback/incident playbook for releases. Risks are tracked in a lightweight Risk Register and reviewed regularly. Retrospectives capture learnings and convert them into prioritized action items that feed back into the backlog to continuously improve team practices.
